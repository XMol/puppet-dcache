    |
    |  If you have any near-line storage that needs
    |  accounting for, write a script that (re-)generates
    |  this file's content at a different location.  The
    |  recommended location for this file is:
    |
    |    /var/opt/dcache/tape-info.xml
    |
    |  You must update the "tape-info" location option within
    |
    |    /opt/d-cache/etc/glue-1.3.xml
    |
    |  accordingly.

    |   A "tape-info" element may have zero or more
    |   "collection" child XML elements.  If there are no
    |   "collection" elements (as with this file) then no
    |   tape accounting information will be reported.

<tape-info>

  <!--+
      |   A "collection" XML element represents a logical
      |   collection of tape usage.  It represents the
      |   near-line capacity that we wish to account for as a
      |   single unit.
      |
      |   Each "collection" XML element must have a "id" XML
      |   attribute.  The "id" attribute value must be unique
      |   within the file and it must be consistent over
      |   successive versions of the file; if the file is
      |   updated then the "collection" element representing
      |   the same set of tapes must have the same "id".
      |
      |   Apart from being unique and consistent, the "id"
      |   attribute value must avoid certain characters.
      |   Space is generally OK, but leading and trailing
      |   space must be avoided; also, the "id" value must
      |   avoid any of the following characters:
      |
      |       , + " \ < > = ; #
      |
      |   The "collection" XML element may have a single
      |   "name" child XML element.  If present, this should
      |   have a description of the collection that is
      |   meaningful to someone.
      |
      |   The "collection" XML element must have a single
      |   "space" XML child element.  This represents the
      |   accounting information about this collection.
      |
      |   Inside the "space" XML element there must be
      |   precisely three child XML elements: "reserved",
      |   "total" and "used".  These child elements each
      |   contain a number representing some aspect of the
      |   near-line capacity, measured in bytes.  They have
      |   the following semantics:
      |
      |      Total: this is the combined native capacity of
      |             all the tapes currently accessible.
      |
      |      Used:  tape usage, after taking compression into
      |             account.  If a 2 GiB file suffers a 50%
      |             compression when stored on tape then the
      |             file contributes 1 GiB to the Used value.
      |
      |      Reserved: Total + the combined native capacity
      |             of any tapes that should be associated
      |             with this collection but are not
      |             currently available.  Examples of such
      |             tapes are those that are on order or
      |             tapes that are currently being repaired.
      |
      |   The following constraints must be observed:
      |
      |       Reserved value >= Total value,
      |       Total value >= Used value.
      |
      |   The "for" XML element is a child of the
      |   "collection" XML element.  It lists for whom the
      |   near-line capacity is provided.  This list is
      |   expressed as a series of "vo" XML elements,
      |   children of the "for" XML element, where the value
      |   of the XML element is the VO's name.
      |
      |   Some (possibly all) of the VOs listed in the "for"
      |   XML element may be able to write into the near-line
      |   storage.  To represent this, the "collection" XML
      |   element may have a single "write-paths" XML element.
      |
      |   If no VO can write into the near-line storage
      |   represented by a collection then the "write-paths"
      |   XML element should be omitted.
      |
      |   The "write-paths" XML element has one or more "vo"
      |   XML elements as children.  The value of these "vo"
      |   elements is the path that that VO must use to
      |   write into the near-line storage represented by
      |   the "collection" element.  Each "vo" XML element
      |   must have a "name" XML attribute with the VO's name.
