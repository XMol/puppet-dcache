# ATLAS wants to restrict write access for anyone who does not
# have the production role to the atlasscratchdisk directory.
# Therefore we map FQANs with production role onto atlasprod
# and everything else onto atlas001. As long as both these
# virtual user accounts do get the same gid in storage-authzdb
# this should work out. (XM 23/01/2013)
